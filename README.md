# ML_Regression-
10 regression algorithms implemented in scikit-learn to perform regression. These 10 algorithms are very popular regression methods: (1) linear regression, (2) k-neighbors regression, (3) Ridge regression, (4) decision tree regression, (5) random forest regression, (6) gradient Boosting regression, (7) SGD regression, (8) support vector regression (SVR), (9) linear SVR, and (10) multi-layer perceptron regression. You are encouraged to read the documentation (and provided references if you would like to know more details) about these methods from scikit-learn, e.g. linear regression is implemented in sklearn.linear model.LinearRegression.
